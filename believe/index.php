			<h1>What We Believe?</h1><p></p>

			<h3 style="color: #990000; font-style: italic;">The Scriptures</h3>
				<p>We believe the Bible is the inspired Word of God.</p>
			<h3 style="color: #990000; font-style: italic;">The Godhead</h3>
				<p>We believe God is One, but manifested in three Persons - the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
			<h3 style="color: #990000; font-style: italic;">Water Baptism</h3>
				<p>The ordinance of water baptism is a symbol of our identification with Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection from the dead.</p>
			<h3 style="color: #990000; font-style: italic;">Holy Spirit Baptism</h3>
				<p>The baptism in the Holy Spirit is a gift from God as promised by Jesus Christ to all believers and is subsequent to the New Birth.</p>
			<h3 style="color: #990000; font-style: italic;">Divine Healing</h3>
				<p>Healing is for the physical and mental ills of the human body and is brought about by the power of God through faith and, if necessary, through the laying on of hands.</p>
			<h3 style="color: #990000; font-style: italic;">Resurrection of the Just</h3>
				<p> As it is written in the Book of Revelation, after the Tribulation, Jesus shall return to earth as King of kings and Lord of lords, and together with the saints, He shall reign.</p>
